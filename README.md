# Data-Structures
This project is a collection of fundamental data structures implemented from scratch in C++.

It serves as a learning exercise in understanding and creating the underlying mechanisms of data structures and the project was part of the DS course. The implemented data structures include:

Unsorted Array
Sorted Array
Binary Tree
AVL Tree
Hashtable

Each implementation focuses on fundamental operations such as insertion, deletion, traversal, and search, demonstrating the core principles of data structure design and manipulation.
